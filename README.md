To use this repository please first install torch-contour:

```
$pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In this repository you can find the code for both:

- Unsupervised Deep-ContourFlow
- One shot learning Deep-ContourFlow.

## Unsupervised Deep ContourFLow:

To use Unsupervised DCF just add your image in `images_test` and run the algorithm using the notebook: `unsupervised_dcf.ipynb`

## One shot learning:

To use the one shot version of the algorithm please provide a support image with a support mask and a query image in `images_test` and run the algorithm using `one_shot_dcf.ipynb`.

if you use the the code please cite the following paper:

<!--
### 0. Download AIDPATH kidney dataset:

1. Register to AIDPATHDB using the link https://mitel.dimi.uniud.it/aidpath-db/app/login.php
2. Create a folder where data will be saved and write its path in ```path_data``` inside the config file.
Donwload the kidney dataset of AIDPATHDB and put the images in a subfolder called ```slides```.


Manual annotations are available in the github in the ```generate_annotations``` folder.

### 1. Extract images:

 ```
cd ./generate_annotations
python extract_images.py
```

This code uses ```annotations.csv``` and the slides downloaded in #0 in folder ```slides``` to extract all the patches centered on each dilated tubule and "false dilated tubule".

The code will create in your data folder:

1. A subfolder 'masks' with the ground truth masks of the 2 class: "False" and  "True" dilated tubule.
2. A subfolder 'images' with the correponding images.
3. A file contour_init.npy that contains the initial contour corresponding to the detection of lumen for each patch.

### 2. Run and get results:

```
cd ./scores
python compute_scores.py
```

This code take 10 random dilated tubule in each slide and fit the One shot learning DCF and predict for all other object in the slide.
It creates a csv file containing all the scores. -->
